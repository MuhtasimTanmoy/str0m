# Tokio Examples

Str0m is an asynchronous WebRTC implementation in Rust that allows the user to choose between synchronous or asynchronous designs for their applications. Str0m also allows the use of any asynchronous runtime and framework, giving developers the flexibility to choose the tools that best suit their needs.

However, these examples showcase the use of the Tokio framework for building high-performance, asynchronous network applications in Rust. Tokio is a widely-used Rust framework that provides a powerful environment for developing applications, especially those involving networking or I/O operations. Alongside Tokio, we also use the Axum web framework to build a simple HTTP server that can receive offers from clients. Axum is built on top of Tokio and provides an efficient way to build web applications in Rust.

For client-side examples, we use the hyper library, which is a HTTP client library built on top of Tokio, providing asynchronous HTTP requests in Rust.
